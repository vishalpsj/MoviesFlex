# MoviesFlex

MoviesFlex is a responsive OTT clone webpage that simulates the style of an online streaming platform. It allows users to browse movies, view detailed data, and select movies from a grid layout. Please note that this is a **dummy application**â€”you cannot watch movies here. It is designed purely for showcasing the OTT-style user interface.

The project uses the TMDB API to fetch movie data and is built with React, React Router, Tailwind CSS, and plain CSS. The project also incorporates Embla Carousel for smooth scrolling through movie selections.

## Features

- Browse a wide range of movies in a grid format.
- View movie details such as title, release date, ratings, and overview.
- Select a movie to view more information.
- Responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Note**: This is a dummy project and does not allow you to stream or watch movies.
